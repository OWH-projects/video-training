<h2>What will you need?</h2>
-Yourself
-Something to take notes with 
*You can bring your iPhone if you want, but it's not required.

We will not be editing in this brown-bag session. Instead we'll spend time looking at what's working and what's not — video-wise — on Omaha.com.

We're also going to look at ways to make your videos better with new editing techniques and shooting tips.

Even if you haven't attended a formal video training with your section *cough* SPORTS *cough*, you'll get something out of this short seminar.
